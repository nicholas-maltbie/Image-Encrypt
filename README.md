# Haskell Image Encrypt

Nicholas Maltbie

## Description

This project will use haskell to encrypt files, text, and images into other 
images using stenography by modifying bit values for images. In order to do 
this, I will utilize a few libraries to edit the images and encrypt values from 
files. 

## Purpose

This is a project for CS 4003, University of Cincinnati, instructor John Franco.
